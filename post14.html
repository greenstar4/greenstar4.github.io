    <p>Transitions aren't just about moving from one clip to the next—they're about *style*. ✨ Mastering transitions can instantly boost the quality and flow of your content. Here are 10 essential transitions every creator should learn and use smartly.</p>

    <h2>🔥 1. Cut on Action</h2>

    <p>Cut from one object or scene to another that visually aligns. Super cinematic! 🎬</p>

    <h2>🌈 3. Crossfade</h2>
    <p>Blend two clips together gently. Perfect for emotional or storytelling videos.</p>

    <h2>🌪️ 4. Zoom Transition</h2>
    <p>Add dramatic energy by zooming in/out between clips. Use motion blur for better effect.</p>

    <h2>📱 5. Swipe Slide</h2>
    <p>A classic for reels and mobile edits—slide from one clip to another horizontally or vertically.</p>

    <h2>🔲 6. Luma Fade</h2>
    <p>Fade using brightness levels. Looks futuristic and clean!</p>

    <h2>🕳️ 7. Spin Transition</h2>
