  <p>Hi, I’m the creator of <strong>Green Star</strong> — a digital space built with passion, purpose, and creativity.</p>
  
  <p>I’m a <strong>web developer, designer, video editor, and programming enthusiast</strong>. My journey began with a simple curiosity about how websites work and how visuals shape our online experience. Over time, that curiosity grew into a full-blown passion for building meaningful, modern, and interactive digital content.</p>
  
  <p>With every line of code I write, every video I edit, and every design I create, I aim to tell a story — your story, my story, or one the world needs to hear. <strong>Green Star</strong> reflects this spirit — a brand focused on visual storytelling, technology, and creative freedom.</p>
  
  <p>Here, you’ll find content about web design, development tips, video editing tricks, creative projects, and personal thoughts on learning and growth in the digital space. Whether you're a fellow creator, a curious learner, or someone looking to connect, I’m happy you're here.</p>
  
  <p><em>Let’s grow, create, and inspire — together.</em></p>
