  <h1>Why Every Creator Needs a Signature Style – And How to Find Yours</h1>
  <p>In a world full of content, your style is your identity. It's the fingerprint that makes your videos instantly recognizable. Green Star believes that finding your editing style is as important as creating content itself.</p>

  <h2>What is a Signature Style?</h2>
  <p>Your style is a mix of transitions, fonts, filters, colors, pacing, and mood. Think of Peter McKinnon’s cinematic shots or MrBeast’s fast-paced energy. You don’t copy it—you create your own vibe.</p>

  <h2>How to Discover Yours</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Review your past edits: What patterns do you notice?</li>
    <li>Pick 3-5 colors that define your mood.</li>
    <li>Use similar transitions or effects to create consistency.</li>
    <li>Create a 10-second brand intro or logo animation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Test, Tweak, Repeat</h2>
  <p>Style isn’t found in a day. Make a few videos. Watch how people react. Adjust. Your editing journey is ongoing—but style gives it direction.</p>

  <p><strong>Green Star helps creators stand out—your journey starts here.</strong></p>
