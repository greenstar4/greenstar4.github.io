    <h1>Connect With Me on Social Media</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my digital world! I'm excited to connect with you through multiple platforms where I share my skills, projects, and behind-the-scenes content. Whether you're a developer, designer, editor, or just someone who loves creativity, there's something for you across my social media profiles.</p>

    <p>Through my journey with <strong>Green Star</strong>, I've learned that community and communication are just as important as creativity and code. Below you'll find all the places where I'm active, and a short guide on what to expect from each.</p>

    <h2>🌟 Where You Can Find Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://youtube.com/@greenstar.2?si=ByDnr9nI5j4zkZc7" target="_blank">📺 YouTube</a> – Video edits, tutorials, vlog intros, motion graphics, and occasional tech content.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/green.star.8?igsh=ajU0Zm82NGM0c2xs" target="_blank">📸 Instagram</a> – Quick design reels, before/after edits, sneak peeks of upcoming projects, and creative posts.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">💻 GitHub</a> – Web apps, blog tools, open-source projects, and code experiments.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/green-star08?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app" target="_blank">🔗 LinkedIn</a> – Professional updates, portfolio links, certificates, achievements, and career posts.</li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/yourusername" target="_blank">🐦 Twitter/X</a> – Short tips, announcements, and quick updates from the creative world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Why I Use These Platforms</h2>
    <p>I believe each platform has a unique strength. YouTube lets me visually share my passion for editing and motion design. Instagram helps me stay creative and consistent with visual storytelling. GitHub is where I open up my developer side to the world. LinkedIn connects me with professionals, while Twitter/X lets me speak casually with the creative and tech community.</p>

    <p>Managing all these might seem like a lot, but it's how I stay inspired and accountable. I also love hearing from others — your feedback, your questions, and your ideas are what make the journey more meaningful.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Let’s Collaborate!</h2>
    <p>If you like what I create and want to collaborate on a project — whether it's a website, an animation, a design, or something new — don’t hesitate to message me. I’m always open to working with passionate people across different fields.</p>

    <p><em>Let’s grow, share, and build a strong creative circle together. Thanks for being here!</em></p>
